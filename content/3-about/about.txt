  principle: Make it better.
  principle_desc: "We're constantly asking ourselves: how can we improve this? It's what drives our decisions, but more than that, it's a part of who we are. Every time we push that extra inch, we learn a little bit more about our craft and about ourselves."

  principle: Keep it simple.
  principle_desc: >
    Life is pretty simple, overall. Humans
    tend to overcomplicate things. We do our
    best not to.

  principle: Quality over quantity.
  principle_desc: "If you're going to create something, you should create it as best you can, right? Even if it takes a little extra time, we believe that quality—not quantity—is the real marker of excellence."

  principle: Question everything.
  principle_desc: 'How is this usually accomplished? Can it be done better? Will people understand what we mean? Are we assuming too much? How does this flow? Do we even need [X, Y, Z]? Are we asking too many questions?'
  principle_lr: right

  principle: Stay honest.
  principle_desc: "A flashy social media campaign won't fix a bad idea. Something isn't exciting just because you call it that. These can be hard truths to swallow, but we do our best to show things as they are. We spotlight the best parts of an idea and try not to glorify the others."
  principle_lr: right
- 
  principle: Have fun.
  principle_desc: "We do our best work when we're not watching the clock. Lucky for you, when we're passionate about a project, the time couldn't be further from our minds."
